A prefab environment for POV-Ray prototypes and experiments.

Version 2.1 errata:

- The User Manual and source code comments say that this module is from the Object Collection. In fact, it has not yet been submitted to the Object Collection.
- The link to the Object Collection Userâ€™s Guide is temporarily down. Use the [Wayback link](https://web.archive.org/web/20120419111948/http://lib.povray.org/usersguide/02using.html) instead.
- The User Manual says that parameter `sotd_Solar` defaults to about 2770 with the default indoor setup. In fact, that is the default only if the user selects the hooded lamp as the main lamp; otherwise, it is about 933.

This project is a module proposed for the Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray) Object Collection.
