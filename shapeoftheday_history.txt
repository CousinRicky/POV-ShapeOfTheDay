ShapeOfTheDay is the fourth in a succession of prefabricated environments I
have used over the years.  The first three generations have not been published.

________________________________________________________________________________

History of the 1st generation rig, environs.inc:

This was my first attempt at a prefabricated environment.  It set up a checkered
plane, a non-graduated plain light blue background, and the lighting.

History of the 2nd generation rig, quickndirty.inc:

This file introduced templates for transparent and specular materials.  Key was
a workaround for a bug in POV-Ray 3.5's Fresnel dispersion.  I also added a
camera with optional depth of field, some basic mathematical functions, and a
lot more lighting options, including an area light and photons.  Oddly, I did
not include a physical setting or a sky.

History of the 3rd generation rig, sotd.inc:

Change of focus: quickndirty.inc materials are not brought over (probably due
to the Fresnel dispersion bug fix in 3.6), and some of its other features are
spun off into a new include file, common.inc, to be called by sotd.inc.

Solutions to checkered plane moire patterns:
 - add an indoor option to limit the extent of the checker pattern
 - replace the checker pattern outdoors with a patchy grassy texture
 - in a later version (probably 3.0), a patio is added for a limited extent
   outdoor checker pattern

(Changes to sotd.inc were not logged in detail.)

sotd.inc depends on several other unpublished include files:
 - common.inc (various and sundry tools)
 - rad.inc (parameter-driven radiosity)
 - lamp.inc (desk lamp)

History of the 4th generation rig, shapeoftheday.inc:

Issues with sotd.inc in POV-Ray 3.7, the ad hoc nature of sotd.inc's #debug
output, and growing disorganization within the code led me to start fresh with
a new file.  Primary among the considerations were:

 - The debug stream output should contain enough information to reconstruct a
   scene without this module (at least for indoor scenes).  This feature has
   already been used in several of the scene files I have posted, including the
   file rc3metal_brushed.pov in the Object Collection.

 - The module should be easily converted for Object Collection compliance,
   in case I decide to submit it to the Object Collection.  To that end, all
   introduced identifiers were given prefixes according to the Object Collection
   standard, which necessitated changing the names of the input parameters.

Other considerations were:

 - Some features of the module should be available for determining parameter
   values before the scene is set up.  In sotd.inc, this was done with a
   separate header include file, but only static values were available under
   that system.  For greater flexibility, setup should not be automatic, but
   requested by the user after the computed values are available.

 - File sotd.inc is heavily dependent on common.inc.  With half an eye towards
   Object Collection feasibility, and with most of the features of common.inc
   having already found their way into the Object Collection anyway, I decided
   that the new file should not depend on it.  (The cores of Caption and
   RC3Metal, parts of RoundEdge, and the undocumented number-to-string macro in
   several of my Object Collection modules were first developed in common.inc.)

   Ultimately, ShapeOfTheDay prerequisites should be limited to standard POV-Ray
   3.5 include files and current or proposed Object Collection modules.

-----  ----         --------
0.9    2012-Aug-01  The file is coded anew, and renamed because it is totally
                    incompatible with sotd.inc.
                     - Parameters are expanded to full words.
                     - Setup is no longer automatic.
                     - Color input formats are made uniform.  Extra
                       parameters are introduced to cope with limitations
                       of command line precision.
                     - Some options are changed or revoked.
                     - Dependence on common.inc and rad.inc is removed,
                       although radiosity awareness is grudgingly
                       accommodated for the sake of pre-3.7 scenes.
       2012-Aug-04  lamp.inc is dropped, having been deemed insufficient for
                    requirements, and for its entanglement with common.inc.
                    A replacement will be used when it comes into being.
       2012-Aug-15  Pitch and yaw directions are reversed, for consistency
                    with camera and light source parameters.
       2012-Sep-27  Ambient values are estimated.
1.0    2012-Sep-27  The module is deemed sufficiently complete to replace
                    sotd.inc, although some features remain unimplemented
                    or incomplete.
1.0.1  2012-Nov-05  The FOV parameter identifier name is changed.
1.1    2013-Jan-03  The orthographic projection is implemented.
       2013-Mar-23  Hills are implemented; the sky color is tweaked.
                    Apparent bug: white splotches appear all over the landscape
                    when radiosity is used with hills in POV-Ray 3.7.  This
                    problem is illustrated at
                      https://news.povray.org/559331b6%40news.povray.org
       2013-Mar-23  Ground fog is partially implemented, turned off by default.
1.2    2013-Apr-02  Parameters are added for hills.
1.2.1  2013-Apr-29  Sotd_Position() returns a single composite transformation.
       2013-Jun-05  Highlights are tentatively removed from the floor and walls.
       2013-Aug-25  Reflection is tentatively disabled for light source avatars
                    until an issue with highlights is settled.
       2013-Aug-26  Tile seams are implemented.
       2013-Dec-31  #debug of light sources is expanded.
       2014-Jan-05  If screen.inc is invoked, its camera calls are #debugged.
1.2.2  2014-Jan-17  A positioning macro is added using the global parameters
                    instead of arguments.
1.2.3  2014-Jun-19  Foliage and dirt colors are changed.
       2015-Feb-12  Baseboards are added to the indoor setting.
       2015-Jun-08  Work is started on isosurface hills as a workaround
                    against the white splotches when height fields are
                    rendered with radiosity in POV-Ray 3.7.  After proof-of-
                    concept, work is postponed when the isosurface does not
                    solve the white splotches problem.
1.3.alpha
       2015-Jun-15  Ground fog is finalized, the color of the Sun is updated,
                    and the clouds are revamped.  Affected ambient values are
                    not yet updated.
1.3    2015-Jun-19  Outdoor ambient values are updated for ground fog.
1.3.1  2015-Jun-29  Sun halo is revised and clouds are tweaked.
1.4    2015-Jul-02  Development of isosurface hills is at a stopping point, and
                    for consistency, the height field hills are updated to use
                    the same functions as the isosurface.  It is discovered that
                    the white splotches do not appear with POV-Ray 3.7.1.
       2015-Jul-26  Rudimentary trees are implemented.
1.4.1  2016-Feb-27  A very rudimentary lamp fixture place holder is added.
1.4.2  2016-Aug-10  Sotd_Position() calls are #debugged.
1.5    2016-Oct-06  If Sotd_Setup() is informed of radiosity, it will automat-
                    ically set media on.  This makes radiosity awareness
                    important even in 3.7+ scenes.
       2016-Oct-06  The grassy field is given a healthier appearance, by using
                    AOI (3.7+) or less dirt (pre-3.7).
       2016-Oct-07  The calculated ambients take the change to the grassy field
                    into account.
       2016-Oct-07  Area light diameters are adjusted to compensate for how
                    POV-Ray computes the grid.  (See Area light idiosyncrasies
                    in p.b.i.)
1.5.1  2017-May-31  Because no_radiosity is not available for #version < 3.7,
                    fade_distance is increased on the light sources in pre-3.7
                    scenes in order to avoid radiosity artifacts from the lamp
                    fixtures.  (The new value needs to be refined to avoid dark
                    light bulbs.)
1.6    2018-Jun-02  Photons are no longer saved automatically; a parameter is
                    added to enable this feature.
1.6    2018-Jun-02  The Sun's color is changed and the grass, hills, and sky are
                    revamped with colors of lower luminance, bringing them more
                    in line with photographic measurements and atmospheric
                    absorption and scattering data.
1.6.1  2018-Jun-09  The solar-to-lamp parameter is given a realistic default.
1.6.2  2018-Jun-15  Sky colors are tweaked, based on a more precise solar
                    illuminance figure.
1.6.2  2018-Jun-15  A white point option is added.
1.6.2  2018-Jun-15  For 3.7+, emission 0 is added to all finishes that include
                    an ambient.
       2018-Jun-18  An exposure parameter is added.
1.6.3  2018-Jun-19  Standard illuminants may be specified for lamps.
       2018-Jun-27  Bug fix: Earth's radius is corrected.
       2018-Jul-31  Sotd_Setup() will set radiosity media on; but only if there
                    is sky fog; i.e., if outdoors or indoors with windows open.
       2018-Aug-07  Standard dimensions (USA) are used for the doors.
1.6.4  2018-Aug-27  The scene’s unit of length can be user-specified.
1.7    2018-Sep-10  Potential scene breaking change: the maximum height of hills
                    is specified in meters, not feet.
       2018-Sep-11  Bug fix: standard illuminants work with POV-Ray < 3.7.
       2018-Sep-15  For POV-Ray < 3.7, the light source fade_distance is refined
                    to avoid dark light bulbs.
       2018-Sep-15  For POV-Ray < 3.7, the Sun's surface brightness is boosted
                    (although to avoid radiosity interference, it is still
                    unrealistically low). The increased brightness is currently
                    moot, but will become important when looks_like reflection
                    is re-enabled.
       2018-Oct-05  The white splotches problem appears to be circumvented by
                    using a broad cylinder instead of an infinite plane.
       2018-Dec-21  POV 3.8 is accommodated (though not taken advantage of), and
                    the calling scene's version is maintained, so long as it is
                    within ShapeOfTheDay's recognized versions (3.50...3.80).
1.7.1  2019-Jan-06  Windowed walls are remodeled for multiple stories.
       2019-Mar-21  View_POV_Include_Stack is utilized.
       2019-Sep-24  The fixed microspacing value is converted to a parameter.
1.7.2  2019-Sep-30  A scene description file is added for the convenience of
                    coordinating the Sun position with the clouds.
       2020-Apr-30  Interest in this rig is expressed by another POVer.
       2020-May-01  The isosurface hills use RoundEdge 2.0's new RE_Evaluate()
                    macro; perhaps tentatively, since the isosurface needs to be
                    overhauled anyway.
       2020-Aug-23  A photons gather radius parameter is added.
       2020-Nov-07  Potential scene breaking change: the cloud position is
                    specified in meters.
       2020-Nov-08  The parameter reference codes are spun off into a separate
                    include file.
1.8    2020-Nov-08  A macro is added to convert non-linear color specifications
                    to linear.
       2020-Nov-11  The patio is re-bricked, and the ambient is adjusted
                    accordingly.
       2020-Nov-13  Patio walls can have an entrance space.
1.8.1  2020-Nov-16  A ramp is created for the door or entrance space.  The
                    Object Collection module PipeMrg is utilized if available.
       2020-Nov-22  The glow around the Sun is extended.
       2020-Nov-25  Bug fix: the open windows ambient is corrected.  (Left wall
                    windows were counted twice, at the expense of right wall
                    windows.)
       2020-Nov-26  Bug fixes: substr() calls are corrected for POV 3.5-3.6's
                    inability to handle short strings; and a potential division
                    by zero is averted in the sky sphere pigment function.
       2020-Nov-28  Sotd_Setup() halts the render if called more than once.
       2020-Nov-29  If there are more windows than a specified maximum, the
                    windows are simulated with a texture.
       2020-Nov-30  Photons autostop is made a parameter.
       2020-Dec-02  Clouds can be moved in the z-direction.
       2020-Dec-03  A fixed microspace is used for those physical structure
                    measures not connected to the floor height.
1.8.2  2020-Dec-03  The default microspace is capped at 1 cm for large user
                    units.
1.8.3  2021-Jan-02  The doorknob is coded in-line, tentatively suspending the
                    prerequisite of an as-yet unpublished include file.
       2021-Jan-03  The unrestricted precision of value and illuminance
                    channels, and the unlimited magnitude of value and
                    illiminance auxiliary parameters are formalized; and the
                    precision of the echoes of the value and illiminance
                    auxiliary parameters is increased to 4 decimal places.
       2021-Jan-03  The horizon and zenith ambients are collapsed into 1 value,
                    as they have turned out nearly identical in practice.
       2021-Jan-06  A normal is added to the simulated windows texture.
       2021-Jan-13  Gloss is added to the floor.
       2021-Jan-18  The gloss highlight is corrected to account for (3.8) or
                    approximate (pre-3.8) the Fresnel effect.
       2021-Jan-19  A parameter is added for cloudiness.
       2021-Jan-20  Unrecognized white points are adjusted with a warning
                    instead of yielding a parse error.
       2021-Jan-21  Extending the Sun glow (2020-Nov-22) reduced the sky
                    gradient more than anticipated, so the fog distance is
                    increased to compensate.
1.8.4  2021-Jan-21  D55 and D75 white points are added, and the 3000 K white
                    point is raised to 3200 K to match indoor film.
       2021-Feb-01  In checking if a lamp is turned off, two instances of .gray
                    are replaced with a direct check for rgb 0.
1.9    2021-Feb-22  Potential scene breaking change: the units parameter is
                    changed from units per meter to meters per unit. This is
                    done for consistency with the SSLT global parameter and the
                    future DeskLamp module; for cleaner values; and to more
                    easily remember these values.
1.9.1  2021-Apr-01  All unit identifiers longer than 1 meter are deleted; but
                    they are still recognized and echoed if debugging is on.
                    ScaleConvert is recommended in the User Manual for units
                    not defined.
       2021-Apr-02  The color channels of the argument to the non-linear color
                    conversion macros are restricted to the domain 0...1.
       2021-Apr-13  The photons file number defaults to the animation frame #.
1.9.2  2021-Apr-16  With improved anti-aliasing in 3.7 and stochastic anti-
                    aliasing in 3.8, an outdoor extended checkered plain option
                    is added.
       2021-Apr-16  A bug in the photons autostop echo is corrected.
       2021-Apr-20  The ground ambient is documented.
       2021-Apr-20  The photons radius arguments have no defaults.
       2021-Apr-20  Undefined parameters are echoed as "undefined."
       2021-Apr-27  The patio may have a railing instead of brick walls.
1.9.3  2021-Apr-27  The ramp railing is customized to the scenery setting.
       2021-Apr-27  The status of pipemrg.inc is reported.
       2021-Apr-28  The photons radius defaults are restored.
       2021-May-03  The assumed_gamma statement is tentatively moved to
                    shapeoftheday_ref.inc to forestall a parse error from the
                    color macros.  The future of these macros is in doubt, as
                    they duplicate macros in DeskLamp, which is a proposed
                    prerequisite for ShapeOfTheDay.
       2021-May-15  The finish diffuse is made a parameter.
       2021-May-17  Bug fix: pixel aspect is fixed.
       2021-May-31  The fatal error for out-of-domain arguments to the non-
                    linear color conversion macros is reduced to a warning.
       2021-Jul-13  Luminance-by-white point vectors are defined in preparation
                    for future DeskLamp usage.
       2021-Jul-13  A test is made for whether RE_Evaluate() is defined, thus
                    allowing for RoundEdge versions prior to 2.0.
1.9.4  2022-Jan-01  HSV lamps are sensitive to color temperature.
1.9.5  2022-Mar-18  The focal plane is adjustable.
